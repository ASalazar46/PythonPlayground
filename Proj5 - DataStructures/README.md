# Title: Data Structures in Python

## Project Number: 5

## Team: Andrew Salazar

### Overview

A project containing a lot of things related to data structures within Python.

### Context

Data structures are objects specialized in efficient data storage and modification. Each data structure will serve different purposes, and knowing how they work will give insight on why they serve those purposes. In addition, efficient data structure implementation leads to optimized application performance. This project will document what I learn.

### Goals

- Experience more Python application building.
- Write more design documents.
- Learn about data structures.

### Achieved Milestones

- [6/5/2022] Project files created.
- [6/7/2022] Read through Python's documentation of lists.

### Current Progress/Solution

List - A simple collection of data, and one of the built-in data structures in Python. It is a sequence data type, meaning items are stored in the order the user set them. Duplicate items are allowed in a list. Lists are mutable, meaning list contents can changed and modified in place after initial creation. Lists are similar to arrays in C, but has a few differences:

- Lists are not restricted to one data type; it can collect data of various types. Arrays are restricted to only one data type.
- Lists dynamically change in size. Arrays set their size upon creation, and it will not change afterwards.
