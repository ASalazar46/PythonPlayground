# Messing With Files

## Project Number: 4

## Team: Andrew Salazar

### Overview

Just a project where I learn about how to read and write to files.

### Context

Input can come from three places: expressions (e.g: `y = x + 1`), interactions (e.g: `input()` and command line arguments), and files. I have already seen and worked with the first two methods of inputs, but now I want to learn more about file input and output.

### Goals

- Experience more Python application building.
- Write more design documents.

### Achieved Milestones

- [6/3/2022] "Project" started

### Current Progress/Solution

The only goal of this "project" is to learn about file input and output. Anything I learn about such will be documented below.
