# Title: Converter
## Project Number: 3
## Team: Andrew Salazar 
### Overview: 
Command line application that contains multiple converters. 
### Context:
Modern calculators usually have built in converters. While this will not
be an extension to the calculator in [project 1](../Proj1%20-%20CalculatorNoGUI/),
I would still like to implement converters of all sorts in this project. 
### Goals:
- Complete the project according to the proposed solution.
- Experience more Python application building.
- Write more design documents.
### Achieved Milestones:
- [5/28/2022] Project files created
### Proposed Solution:
