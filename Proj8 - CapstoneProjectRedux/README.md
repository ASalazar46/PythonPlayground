# Capstone Project Redux

## Project Number: 8

## Team: Andrew Salazar

### Overview

Acquire data from a database and display it on a dashboard.

### Context

A rough remake of the project I worked on for my engineering capstone projects (EE396 & EE496). This project was focused on gathering weather pattern data of the local area, retrieving and managing the data on a server, and displaying it on a website dashboard for analysis. There were multiple teams working on different parts of the project. My team was assigned to maintain the website dashboard that displays the data. For the time I was contracted to work on this project, I found it to be a huge learning experience. In my adventure to learn Python, I decided to redo this project using Python and Python-based frameworks. I don't have access to the project's documentation and source code for reference anymore (because I graduated), so what I mean by "rough remake" is this: I will do all of the work I remember doing for this project, in addition to patching in missing project pieces with new things.

### Goals
