Project Number: 1
Title: Calculator No GUI
Team: Andrew Salazar (just me)
Overview: 
    A command line application that functions as a calculator. Will
    save implementing a GUI for a different project.
Context:
    After reading through the Python tutorial provided by the official 
    docs page (http://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial) I searched for
    beginner Python projects. This idea was one of the first that I saw, 
    and I chose to do this project first. 
Goals:
    From this project, I will:
    - Learn the basics of organizing Python code into applications (no 
    matter how small or useless they are to anyone). 
    - Take my first steps towards becoming accustomed to project building. 
    - Become familiar with writing design documents (even if small at first).
    - Complete the project and produce a working application 
Achieved Milestones:
    - [5/20/2022] Project folder and design document (this README.md) created.
    - 
Proposed Solution:
    This calculator should be able to handle PEMDAS operations, at minimum, to
    be considered complete. As a reminder, PEMDAS stands for: parentheses, exponentials,
    multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. The priority in which PEMDAS 
    operators execute is from left to right. Operations in parentheses execute first, then
    exponentials, then multiplication and division (which ever of these operators appear
    first from left to right), then addition and subtraction (which ever of these operators 
    appear first from left to right).
    Feel free to add in other operations afterwards.
